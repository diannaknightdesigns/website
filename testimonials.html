        We recently moved after 30 years and found ourselves in a new home with lots of "empty spaces". Working with Dianna was very enjoyable. She was able to combine our ideas and vision with her experiences and expertise to come up with some great plans for our new home. We really appreciated her patience with us as we changed our minds a few times during the project. Professional and pleasant would be a great way to describe Dianna. We were very pleased with the work she did for us.

        We retained Dianna's design services a couple of times for direction on our main floor living room and with our teens' bedrooms. In all cases, we were looking for budget friendly ideas to pull the rooms together without having to replace the big furniture pieces. With her eye for art and accessorizing, and following up on her suggestions for colour, bedding and furniture, we love the final rooms. She arrived totally prepared and we could not have done this without her help.

        My accommodation is a unique master bedroom in a large shared home, and with it looking like I would be staying there for a while I really felt the need to make it homier and more suited to my personality. Having seen so many house design TV shows, I really felt that getting a professional was worth the money, and knew that Dianna had branched into that field after she retired from teaching. I reached out to her and was really happy with the results. I didn't have a huge budget, and she was able to suggest a lot of options that quickly and inexpensively transformed my space. Her in-person consultation and guidance through the purchasing process was extremely helpful, and the end result was even better than I had hoped. Her expertise, combined with her professional but friendly personality made it a very rewarding experience.
